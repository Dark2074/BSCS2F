            [Chorus]<br>
            Sometimes I'm alright, sometimes I don't know<br>
            Watching time fly makes me feel old<br>
            Sometimes you move up, sometimes you lose track<br>
            But all the ups and downs that life has got me coming right back<br>
            
            [Verse 1]<br>
            You got your ups and your downs, confident to clown<br>
            You could feel left out of your own damn house<br>
            Be on top of the world, kissin' on a girl<br>
            So nervous you could feel what it means to be real<br>
            You can need your own space, get your own place<br>
            But feel so alone when nobody wants to stay<br>
            You could finally fall in love<br>
            You fit just like a glove, then find out you're not enough, no<br>
            
            [Chorus]<br>
            Sometimes I'm alright, sometimes I don't know<br>
            Watching time fly makes mе feel old<br>
            Sometimes when I'm high my mind is so low<br>
            Wondеring why my room is so cold<br>
            Sometimes I'm in love, sometimes I fall fast<br>
            Losing my trust, run from my past<br>
            Sometimes you move up, sometimes you lose track<br>
            But all the ups and downs that life has got me coming right back<br>
            And all the ups and downs that life has got me coming right back<br>
        </div>
